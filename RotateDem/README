#RotateDEM:

This code takes a digital elevation model (DEM) topographic map, such as 30-meter SRTM elevation data, and extracts the desired square section with a specified side length, L.
The code cut the dem as an square with length of L, rotated counterclockwise by theta degrees with respect to the latitude and longitude values at the left corner and  translated to the local coordinate system with the origin at (0,0).
